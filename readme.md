# JavaScript Modules

A blog post about using NPM and ES6 modules. If you have any corrections, suggestions, clarifications 

Includes some very simple Browserify and Webpack ES6 Module examples in the `example-code` directory.

### To run:

`npm install`

Then run:

`npm run bundle` for browserify or `npm run webpack` for webpack. The brains behind these commands are in tgihe `package.json` file and `webpack.config.js`.
